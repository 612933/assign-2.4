hadoop in layman's term:
 Hadoop is a collection of open source programs/procedures relating to Big Data analysis.
 it is freely available for use, reuse and modification (with some restrictions) for anyone who is interested in it.
 hadoop is called the backbone of operations in big data
 Hadoop comprises mainly of 4 modules namely, DFS, MapReduce, Hadoop Common and YARN.
 hadoop common:it conains java based user tool which is used to retrieve and access daa fro hadoop file system
 Distributed File System (DFS):it is responsible for easy retrieve and access of data.
 Yarn: it manages the system resources.
 MapReduce:it reads data from databases and puts them into a format that is suitable for Big Data Analytics.it alo breakdown the data in more meaningful form.
 
 Component of hadoop framework:
 the thre core comopent of haddop framework are 1.map reduce 2.hdfs 3.yarn.
 1 Map reduce:Map reduce is a progamming model to process larer set of data in parallel.
 2.hdfs:it can store all kind of data without any previous oranization. It takes care of storing data of petabyte scale.
 Yarn: it schedules and handles resource requests from distributed applications.
  Eplain the reasons to learn Big data technologies:
  these are the reasons to learn big data technology:
  1. No signs of slowing down: More people have access to mobile devices that sense and acquire information through the likes of cameras, microphones, etc.
2 Everyone uses Big Data: not only it secor uses big data rather Big Data is everywhere, from politics to health care to even sports.
3.Information Managers in Demand:Someone has to be able to implement, run, and manage the software used to analyze Big Data. So, in conjunction with the rise of Big Data, the demand for information management specialists has increased. 
4.Software Options Galore. Major players such as Microsoft, IBM, Oracle have spent billions investing in data analytics and management software,this shows how big big data is.
To learn other tech:it provide not only the storage requied to store larger amount of data but also the power required to analyze this data.
